# Sample Snack app

The [PocketPhonics Web App](https://snack.expo.dev/@paradoxflame/pocketphonics) is designed to help early stage readers practice reading words. The user can enter any word and the app will break it down into its phonal chunks. The user can then tap on the phonal chunks to hear the corresponding sound.

To start, open the **[PocketPhonics Web App](https://snack.expo.dev/@paradoxflame/pocketphonics)**. You can choose either the `Web`,`Android`, or `iOS` browser emulators, or choose to `Run on your device`.
